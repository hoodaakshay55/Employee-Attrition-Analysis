Project Summary and Key Insights:
Overall attrition rate is 16.12%, which indicates the proportion of employees who have left the company.
Age Distribution: Employees between the age group of 25 to 35 appear more likely to leave the organization.
Years at Company: Higher attrition is observed among employees with lower tenure (especially 0-3 years).
Monthly Income: Employees with lower monthly incomes show a higher tendency to leave, suggesting income may influence retention.
Correlation Insights: 'MonthlyIncome' and 'TotalWorkingYears' are moderately correlated, but neither has a strong correlation with attrition directly.
Department-wise Trends: The Sales and Research & Development departments show a higher number of employee exits compared to HR.
Job Role Analysis: Roles like 'Sales Executive' and 'Laboratory Technician' show relatively higher attrition rates.
